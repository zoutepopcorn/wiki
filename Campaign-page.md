# Campaign page

An important way of reaching your audience is via your own campaign page. It is useful for finding new team members and attracting companies and sponsors. On this page you can find how you can get your own campaign page and how to use it.

## 1. Getting in touch with us

## 2. Information needed to build your campaign page
To set up your campaign page you need a few pieces of information:

* city: what city or area are you going to cover?
* mission: mission of your campaign in 1 sentence - what you want to accomplish and why. For example: "On a mission to provide ..[your city]... with a free IOT data network!"
* description: more information about your campaign, your team and your goals. Get people excited! 
* the coordinates of your city/area. [[Getting-the-coordinates-of-your-city-or-area]]
* a background image: showing your city/area, for example a skyline, something iconic or a picture showing why you are doing this
* thumbnail: a small, iconic image for the city/area you are covering
* contact information: How people can contact you, e.g. the forum, twitter, facebook, mail address telephone number
